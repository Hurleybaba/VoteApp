# Secure Voting Application

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for UI structure and styling
- React.js for responsive UI components

### Backend

- Node.js + Express for server logic
- Python (Face Recognition Library + OpenCV) for facial recognition
- MongoDB for data storage
- JWT for authentication
- Nodemailer for OTP emails
- RESTful APIs for system integration

## Security Measures

### Multi-Factor Authentication

1. **Username/Password Authentication**

   - Initial login security layer
   - JWT-based session management
   - Secure password storage

2. **Email Verification**

   - OTP (One-Time Password) sent via Nodemailer
   - Email validation during registration
   - Secure communication channel

3. **Facial Recognition**
   - Real-time face detection and verification
   - Anti-spoofing measures
   - Biometric data encryption

### Data Security

- JWT token-based authentication for all API requests
- Secure session management
- Encrypted data transmission
- Protection against unauthorized access
- Sensitive data filtering in API responses

### Vote Security

- One vote per eligible user enforcement
- Anti-fraud checks to prevent self-voting
- Vote confirmation process
- Audit logging of voting activities
- Immutable vote records

## Eligibility Verification

### KYC (Know Your Customer) Process

1. **Academic Verification**

   - Department verification
   - Faculty validation
   - Matric number verification
   - Level/Year of study confirmation

2. **Identity Verification**
   - Personal information validation
   - Student status confirmation
   - Age verification
   - Phone number verification

### Multi-Step Voting Process

1. ID Validation
2. Candidate Selection
3. Facial Recognition Verification
4. Vote Confirmation

### Access Control

- Role-based access control
- Verification status checks
- Election-specific eligibility rules
- Real-time eligibility validation

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability:

### Frontend Layer (Vote_app/)

- **Presentation Layer**: Components directory for reusable UI elements
- **Application Logic**: App directory containing core business logic
- **Asset Management**: Assets directory for static resources
- **Configuration**: Constants directory for app-wide settings
- **Styling**: Tailwind configuration for consistent styling

### Backend Layer (Backend/)

- **API Layer**: Routes directory handling HTTP endpoints
- **Business Logic**: Controllers directory managing application logic
- **Data Access Layer**: Database configuration and models
- **Middleware Layer**: Authentication, validation, and error handling
- **Utility Layer**: Utils directory for helper functions
- **Configuration Layer**: Config directory for environment settings
- **Security Layer**: JWT implementation and facial recognition processing

### Integration Layer

- RESTful APIs connecting frontend and backend
- Middleware for request/response processing
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Email service integration via Nodemailer

This layered approach provides:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability and testability
- Scalable and modular codebase
- Easy integration of new features
- Secure and robust architecture
